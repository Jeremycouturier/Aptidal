  abstract = {Resonant chains are groups of planets for which each pair is in resonance, with an orbital period ratio locked at a rational value (2/1, 3/2, etc.). Such chains naturally form as a result of convergent migration of the planets in the proto-planetary disk. In this article, I present an analytical model of resonant chains of any number of planets. Using this model, I show that a system captured in a resonant chain can librate around several possible equilibrium configurations. The probability of capture around each equilibrium depends on how the chain formed, and especially on the order in which the planets have been captured in the chain. Therefore, for an observed resonant chain, knowing around which equilibrium the chain is librating allows for constraints to be put on the formation and migration scenario of the system. I apply this reasoning to the four planets orbiting {$<$}ASTROBJ{$>$}Kepler-223{$<$}/ASTROBJ{$>$} in a 3:4:6:8 resonant chain. I show that the system is observed around one of the six equilibria predicted by the analytical model. Using N-body integrations, I show that the most favorable scenario to reproduce the observed configuration is to first capture the two intermediate planets, then the outermost, and finally the innermost.},

This reducing transformation leads to a very simple explanation of the puzzling behaviour of the Apocentric Librators, a class of asteroids identified by Franklinet al. (1975). An exploration of the phase space of the average problem with the use of the mapping technique shows that the alternation of two libration mechanism is a common feature for initial conditions near, but not inside, the deep resonance region.},

  abstract = {We analyse the global structure of the phase space of the planar planetary 2/1 mean-motion resonance in cases where the outer planet is more massive than its inner companion. Inside the resonant domain, we show the existence of two families of periodic orbits, one associated to the librational motion of resonant angle ({$\sigma$}-family) and the other related to the circulatory motion of the difference in longitudes of pericentre ({$\Delta\varpi$}-family). The well-known apsidal corotation resonances (ACR) appear as intersections between both families. A complex web of secondary resonances is also detected for low eccentricities, whose strengths and positions are dependent on the individual masses and spatial scale of the system. The construction of dynamical maps for various values of the total angular momentum shows the evolution of the families of stable motion with the eccentricities, identifying possible configurations suitable for exoplanetary systems. For low-moderate eccentricities, several different stable modes exist outside the ACR. For larger eccentricities, however, all stable solutions are associated to oscillations around the stationary solutions. Finally, we present a possible link between these stable families and the process of resonance capture, identifying the most probable routes from the secular region to the resonant domain, and discussing how the final resonant configuration may be affected by the extension of the chaotic layer around the resonance region.},

  abstract = {The dynamical stability of tightly packed exoplanetary systems remains poorly understood. While a sharp stability boundary exists for a two-planet system, numerical simulations of three-planet systems and higher show that they can experience instability on timescales up to billions of years. Moreover, an exponential trend between the planet orbital separation measured in units of Hill radii and the survival time has been reported. While these findings have been observed in numerous numerical simulations, little is known of the actual mechanism leading to instability. Contrary to a constant diffusion process, planetary systems seem to remain dynamically quiescent for most of their lifetime before a very short unstable phase. In this work, we show how the slow chaotic diffusion due to the overlap of three-body resonances dominates the timescale leading to the instability for initially coplanar and circular orbits. While the last instability phase is related to scattering due to two-planet mean motion resonances (MMRs), for circular orbits the two-planets MMRs are too far separated to destabilise systems initially away from them. The studied mechanism reproduces the qualitative behaviour found in numerical simulations very well. We develop an analytical model to generalise the empirical trend obtained for equal-mass and equally spaced planets to general systems on initially circular orbits. We obtain an analytical estimate of the survival time consistent with numerical simulations over four orders of magnitude for the planet-to-star-mass ratio {$\varepsilon$}, and 6 to 8 orders of magnitude for the instability time. We also confirm that measuring the orbital spacing in terms of Hill radii is not adapted and that the right spacing unit scales as {$\varepsilon$}\textsuperscript{1/4}. We predict that beyond a certain spacing, the three-planet resonances are not overlapped, which results in an increase of the survival time. We confirm these findings with the aid of numerical simulations of three-planet systems with different masses. We finally discuss the extension of our result to more general systems, containing more planets on initially non-circular orbits.},

  abstract = {Recent works on three-planet mean motion resonances (MMRs) have highlighted their importance for understanding the details of the dynamics of planet formation and evolution. While the dynamics of two-planet MMRs are well understood and approximately described by a one-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian, little is known of the exact dynamics of three-body resonances besides the cases of zeroth-order MMRs or when one of the bodies is a test particle. In this work, I propose the first general integrable model for first-order three-planet mean motion resonances. I show that one can generalize the strategy proposed in the two-planet case to obtain a one-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian. The dynamics of these resonances are governed by the second fundamental model of resonance. The model is valid for any mass ratio between the planets and for every first-order resonance. I show the agreement of the analytical model with numerical simulations. As examples of application, I show how this model could improve our understanding of the capture into MMRs as well as their role in the stability of planetary systems.},
